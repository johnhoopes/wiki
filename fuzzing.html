<p>Jared Demott - EFS (Exploratory Fuzzing)</p>
<p>Sidewinder &nbsp;from whom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constraint solvers</p>
<p>Sage from Microsoft</p>
<p>AFL&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Springfield (SAGE based fuzzing service)</p>

<p>Questions:</p>
<p>How to fuzz network daemon. &nbsp;I can find read and change value read. &nbsp;How to set state to something valid before continuing. &nbsp;In case of tcpserver, it's going to try to write a response back. &nbsp;Is that the right place to terminate execution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<p>Echo demon</p>
<p>connect from client with nc</p>
<p>work out a way to break on the read</p>
<p>what structures need to be in place to fuzz from that point?</p>
<p>&nbsp; - likely the network structure needs to stay in place</p>
<p>&nbsp; - possibly just the socket number (interesting to change it :) )</p>
<p>How to go back and fake that a packet came in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- New thread?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Manipulate context of existing thread?</p>
<p>What about forking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
