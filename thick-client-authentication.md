<!-- SUBTITLE: Thick Client Authentication Issues -->

* How does the application manage users?
* Is the user database local or remote?
	* Seen at least one app that passed the entire user database to the thick client for verification... in plain text
* How are credentials passed?
	* Are username and password sent together?
		* If separate, can you skip sending the password and still function?
		* Enumeration possible?
