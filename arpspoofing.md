<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Arpspoofing -->

# Areas to investigate
Arp spoofing on wireless.  If you spoof a victim, do they talk through the AP or not?

What are the default timeout values for windows / linux for optimal spoofing without too much flooding?

Unsolicited... Who accepts them?  Is this configurable?

How hard is the race condition between request and response?

If two responses received which is honored?

How long do you have to respond before it's considered unsolicited?

How do commercial AP's deal with non-dhcp addrs?  Do they allow them to communicate?
