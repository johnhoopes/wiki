# Notes for myresponder
Looks like this might do most of what I wanted in myresponder.  May kill my project

net.probe - udp packets to discover hosts.
net.recon - constantly listening building a map
tcp.proxy (not sure yet, but looks like something I'm working on now)
net.probe - has a bunch of respnding things.
need to look into wifi tab.
amazing.
