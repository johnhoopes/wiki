# Notes for myresponder
Looks like this might do most of what I wanted in myresponder.  May kill my project

net.probe - udp packets to discover hosts.
net.recon - constantly listening building a map
tcp.proxy (not sure yet, but looks like something I'm working on now)
net.probe - has a bunch of respnding things.
need to look into wifi tab.
amazing.

Relook.  It does some stuff but doesn't do the attacks I want.
Doesn't do as much packet stuff as I'd like.
Doesn't set up arbitrary wireless networks like I want.
UI is amazing.  I don't know Go.  Answer:
Make my web into a restful interface compatible with their UI.
Bonus... get to study a great UI.

Command line interface is also really good.  How to bring it back to Python?
