# Wedge

Color: Black
Desc: Direct USB.  Looks like a wedge, dual antenna
MAC: Dragon doesn't have the driver for it. virtbox controller might also be issue
USB Desc:  MediaTek Inc. MT7612U 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wireless Adapter

Probably an important card.  Will have to come back to it.
Check straight ubuntu
