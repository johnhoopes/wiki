# Utilities
plist.py - list of processes
pmap.py - takes pid, or executable name.
ptrace.py should be fun, but haven't tried it yet.
selectmyparent.py - inherits handles... tokens?

crashlogger.py - very interesting.  Meant to detect crashes and might be able to determine exploitability.  Very coool!
