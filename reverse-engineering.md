# Summary
Using tools to understand how something works.  Often involving dissassembly or decompiling.  Humans don't read machine code all that well.  To get around that we use disassembly tools to produce assembly code. Ideally the tools then allow you to explore the disassembled code and move from function to function learning how an application works.

There are many forms of disassembly tools that can be used depending on how the application was written:
* [Windows PE Binary Disassembly](/windowspe-disassembly)
* [Linux Disassembly](/linuxelf-disassembly)
* [.Net Disassembly](/dotnet-disassembly)
* [Java Disassembly](/java-disassembly)
