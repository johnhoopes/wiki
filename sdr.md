# Devices
## Ettus USRP B210
[B210](/ettus_b210)
 - Full Duplex
 - 70 Mhz - 6 Ghz
 - USB 3.0
 - 61 Msps quadrature 
 - 56 Mhz RF Bandwidth
 - Full Duplex Operation
 - 12 bit samples (maybe)
## RTL-SDR
[RTL-SDR](/rtl-sdr)
- Frequencies Vary - http://rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/
- 22-2200Mhz depending on which chip is present
- max sustainable sample rate 2.56 MS/s
- 8 bit samples but real sensitivity is about 7bit
- 
## HackRF
[hackrf](/hackrf)
- 1 MHZ - 6 Ghz
 - Half Duplex  
 - 20Mhz Sample Rate
 - 8-bit samples
 - Usb 2.0
## BladeRF
- 300Mhz - 3.8 Ghz
- 12bit Sample
- 40 Msps
- 16bit dac (transmission accuracy?)
- Usb 3.0
-
## Yard Stick One
- Different than SDR (same chip as IM-ME)
# Projects
[Ham Projects that don't use SDR on another page](/ham_projects)

* (DONE) Make an Oscilator Circuit - [555 timer](/555timer)
* (DONE) Watch it on oscope/Logic Analyzer
* (DONE) Listen to it with headphones / speaker
